Future TODO plans and notes

* use [liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info/) containers for High availability, and to add some radio station logic etc. Use stream silence detection to swap between MPD servers.

* feed MPD audio stream/s to a pool of [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) containers so we can scale out for more listeners.

* secondary MPD container for alternate stream.
